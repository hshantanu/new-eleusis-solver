Repository for New Eleusis

* This is solver for the card game New Eleusis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusis_(card_game))
* We have designed and implemented a probabilistic ranking algorithm for solving the card game 'New Eleusis' using inductive reasoning. The algorithm uses the existing board state as training data and formulates ranked hypotheses to predict the card rule using weighted card characteristics as the building blocks.

#Prerequisites:
* Python 2.7
